🏋️ Gym Data Analysis Project

📌 Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a gym members dataset to understand workout patterns, calorie burn efficiency, BMI distribution, and age-based fitness trends. The analysis is done using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Plotly.

📂 Dataset Information

- File Name: gymdata.xlsx  
- File Type: Excel (.xlsx)  
- The dataset contains gym member records including personal details, health metrics, and workout information.

 📊 Main Columns in the Dataset:
- Age
- Gender
- Height (m)
- Weight (kg)
- BMI
- Workout Type
- Workout Frequency (days/week)
- Experience Level
- Calories Burned
- Session Duration (hours)
- Max BPM
- Resting BPM

 🧹 Data Processing Steps
- Checked dataset structure and missing values  
- Removed duplicates  
- Converted data types where required  
- Created new calculated columns (HRR, BMI Category, Calories per Hour, Age Group)  

 📈 Key Analysis Performed
- Most effective workout type (based on calories burned)
- BMI category distribution
- Age vs BMI relationship
- Gender vs workout frequency comparison
- Age group vs experience level analysis

 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Plotly Express
- Gooogle colab

🎯 Conclusion
This project demonstrates practical data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization skills by analyzing real-world gym fitness data.
